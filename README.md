# Back Propagation in Convolution Neural Networks

Convolution Neural Network is widely used for various tasks in analyzing visual imagery. Such tasks include image/video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, and natural language processing.

In our final project, we want to explore specifically how CNN classifies number digits (0-9) based on the hand written images. In this case, we would want to utilize the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits images for training image processing systems) and to see how our model predicts the result of test images after training after a short period of time.
